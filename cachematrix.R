#Together, makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve calculate the inverse of a matrix and store it in a variable. 
#So long as the matrix of interest remains unchanged, the inverse stored in this 'cache' variable will be used 
#for all subsequent requests for the inverse, rather than undertaking costliy re-computation each time. 


#This function takes a matrix as its input and returns a list of 4 functions. It also defines a cache 
#variable. The 4 functions in the list allow the retrieval and change of the input matrix and 
#the cache variable. Whenever the input matrix is changed, the cache variable is reset to NULL.

#This function takes, as an input, a list of 4 functions constructed by the makeCacheMatrix function.

#computes the inverse, stores it in the cache, and then returns it.
